O primeiro relacionamento internacional da KMC foi estabelecido em 1975 com a cidade de Eugene, Oregon, Estados Unidos. Essa atividade foi aprimorada ainda mais com o estabelecimento de relações formais com outras 8 cidades: Cidade de Motsumoto, Japão, Rochester, EUA, Yangon (antiga Rangum) de Mianmar, Xian da República Popular da China, Minsk da Bielorrússia e Pyongyang de República Democrática da Coréia. O esforço constante da KMC é aprimorar sua interação com os países da SAARC, outras agências internacionais e muitas outras grandes cidades do mundo para alcançar melhores programas de gestão urbana e desenvolvimento para Katmandu.</td>\n",

As chuvas são principalmente baseadas em monções (cerca de 65% do total concentrado durante os meses das monções de Junho a agosto) e diminuem substancialmente (100 a 200 cm) do leste do Nepal ao oeste do Nepal. As chuvas foram registradas em cerca de 1.400 milímetros (55,1 polegadas) no vale de Katmandu e em média 1.407 milímetros (55,4 polegadas) na cidade de Katmandu. Em média, a umidade é de 75%. O gráfico abaixo é baseado em dados do Bureau de Padrões e Meteorologia do Nepal, \"Meteorologia Meteorológica\" de 2005. O gráfico fornece temperaturas mínimas e máximas durante cada mês.

A década de 2000-2010 viu anomalias de precipitação altamente variáveis e sem precedentes em Katmandu. Isso ocorreu principalmente devido à variação anual das monções do sudoeste.

The code above only keeps answers that are inside the context, we need to also grab the score for the impossible answer (which has start and end indices corresponding to the index of the CLS token). When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the *minimum* of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.\n",
